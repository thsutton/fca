Module: FCA
Maintainer: Thomas Sutton

This module implements an algorithm to perform Formal Concept Analysis on a
concept. The algorithm is that described in /Introduction to Lattices and Order/
(second edition) by B. A. Davey and H. A. Priestly.

This implementation is rather hackish and probably quite inefficient but
helped me (rather: is helping me) to understand to topic.
